## Why use Mirascope?

**Mirascope** is a library purpose-built for prompt engineering on top of <a href="https://pydantic.dev" target="_blank">Pydantic</a>

**Mirascope** has a number of utility classes and functions such as `Prompt` and `messages` to enable more elegant prompt engineering (according to our opinionated point of view)

The primary goal of **Mirascope** is to improve **deverloper experience** through **autocomplete**, **inline errors**, and **validation** by providing better support for type checking and validation tools such as **mypy** and **Pydantic**. This in turn helps to ensure code is **maintainable** and **bug-free**. 

**Mirascope** also tries to improve **convenience** and **simplicity** when building LLM apps through lightweight convenience wrappers built around the OpenAI Python SDK. You can use the <a href="https://docs.together.ai/docs/openai-api-compatibility" target="_blank">Together AI API</a> to use these convenience wrappers with different models, such as <a href="https://mistral.ai/" target="_blank">Mistral AI</a>.

## ðŸš¨ Warning

<!-- This library is going to blow your socks off, so make sure you're sitting down for what you're about to see... -->
Once you go mirascope, you never go backascope...

## Requirements

As **Mirascope** is built on top of **Pydantic**, which is the only strict requirement and will be included automatically during installation.

The Prompt CLI and LLM Convenience Wrappers have additional requirements, which you can opt-in to include if you're using those features.

## Installation

Install Mirascope and start building with LLMs in minutes.

```sh
$ pip install mirascope
```

This will install the `mirascope` package.

To include extra dependencies, run:

```sh
$ pip install mirascope[cli]     #  Prompt CLI
$ pip install mirascope[openai]  #  LLM Convenience Wrappers
$ pip install mirascope[all]     #  All Extras
```
