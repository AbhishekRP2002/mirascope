    "In the past, users had to rely on search engines and manually browse through multiple web pages to find answers to their questions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized this process. They can efficiently utilize search engine results pages (SERPs) and extract relevant content from websites. By leveraging this information, LLMs can quickly provide accurate answers to user queries, eliminating the need for active searching. Users can simply pose their questions and let the LLM work in the background, significantly streamlining the information retrieval process.\n",
